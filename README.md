# Adventurer Journey - Back End
Please complete the story below and create a program to solve the problem. Commit any work back to the remote no later than 48 hours before the next interview.

*Please use whatever languages, references and tooling you would like to complete the story.*

## Story Instructions
You are an adventurer standing in the center of a map facing North, and youâ€™re trying to weave through the terrain to your final destination. You have the directions to your destination indicating the number of steps and the direction to travel.

Adventurer Path & Instructions - [./Adventurer Path.md](./Adventurer%20Path.md)

Given the Path Instructions above, programmatically parse the instructions and determine what is the Euclidean (straight line) distance from your starting point to the destination in steps?

**Tech Notes:**
- Use whatever languages, references and tooling you would like.
- Provide any needed instructions to run program.
- Do not round to the nearest step.
- After program executes the answer should be returned.

# Running the Program
This is a Java project using the Gradle build system. This repository
includes the Gradle wrapper, so you should be able to run `./gradlew <command>`
directly from the command line in the project directory if gradle is not
installed globally on your machine.

You will need **Java 17** in order to build and run this project, as it uses
modern Java features like `switch` expressions and record classes. You can check
your installed Java version by running `java -version`. If you don't already have Java 17 installed,
I recommend [Eclipse Adoptium's "temurin" release](https://github.com/adoptium/temurin17-binaries/releases/).

Run `./gradlew build` to build the project, or `./gradlew test` to run the
project's unit tests. Look in `./build/libs` to find the compiled binary.

Run the jar using `java -jar ./build/libs/Adventurer-1.0-SNAPSHOT 15F6B6B5L16R8B16F20L6F13F11R`,
or replace the argument with a path of your choice.

Alternatively, if you have JetBrains IDEA, you can import the project
and use the IDE to build, test, and run it.
